## Intro

### About me: 
- Geography and Tourism studies
- Switched to web with WordPress
- Embraced Drupal in 2014 (Drupal 7)
- Worked in small agencies, big companies and world-distributed teams
- Hong Kong, Spain, France, Canada and back to France
- Now freelance fullstack Drupal developer (frontend + backend) - remote only

### My "contrib" situation

**Not as active as I wish with Drupal contribution**
- Find hard to contribute with "patch" - even still not clear with Gitlab issues
- Struggle to understand long discussions on Drupal issues
- Still lost with ongoing initiatives or to participate in "hot topics"

**Do not manage to share my experience with the community efficiently**
- I create modules everyday - some smalls (custom blocks), others quite advanced (calendar views or integration with *AWS Cognito* for instance...)
- No time to write a blog :(
- No time to write tests :/

So I publish a few modules: 
- Not perfect nor bullet-proof
- But 100% real-world problems solving
